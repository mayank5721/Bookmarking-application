# Bookmarking-application
This repo contains a basic structure of a bookmarking application thrill.io. The application allows users to save and organize their favorite websites, articles, and resources for easy access and reference. It includes features such as user authentication, bookmark creation, categorization, search functionality, and a user-friendly interface.

PS: I am still working on it..
